# The Best Yelp Review Project Ever  

## Project Description

**Project Idea: LSTM, bi-LSTM and Attention model**

* Implement a simple LSTM, bi-LSTM and Attention model for Yelp Review Polarity. It is a binary classification problem for NLP. You should compare the accuracies for these three models

* Description:
    * Sentiment analysis is a popular topic in NLP. This project helps you apply LSTM to solve real world problems. You can start by building a basic LSTM model and gradually go to more complicated models.
    * Yelp Review Polarity is a publicly available dataset on Kaggle. It contains customersâ€™ reviews and their attitudes, positive or negative. It is a binary classification problem.
